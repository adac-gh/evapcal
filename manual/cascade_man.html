<ul><li>Introduction</ul>


     The program CASCADE was written by F. Puhlhofer to perform evaporation
calculations based upon the statistical theory of compound nucleus reactions
[see F. Puhlhofer, Nucl.Phys.A280(1977)267]. The program was originally written
for an IBM computer but was modified to run on the VAX by Garman and Zwarts.
E.F. Garman modified the original version to include electric dipole gamma
decay properly by introducing the giant dipole resonance (GDR) strength
function and including gamma decay from the compound nucleus (not calculated at
all in puehlhofer original version of CASCADE) according to recommendations by
Puhlhofer. F. Zwarts then included parity in a simplified way to be able to
perform calculations for special states of good spin and parity. Major changes
were introduced by M.N. Harakeh to include isospin and parity properly in the
statistical decay as well as electric quadrupole decay by including the
quadrupole strength function for the isoscalar and isovector giant quadrupole
resonances (GQR). These changes are documented in another report. Here only the
description of the input cards is documented.
     There are two versions of the program CASCADE available now: one version
CASCIP that treats isospin and parity exactly and therefore is large and slow;
another version CASCN which treats parity approximately and thus is about a
factor four faster than CASCIP. Unless there is justification to use program
CASCIP e.g. for light nuclei where isospin plays an important role in
determining the branching ratios of proton, neutron, alpha and gamma decay,
one should use the smaller and faster program CASCN.
     Before running either version of the program CASCADE one should make
sure that a table of binding energies (EBTABLE.DAT) of different nuclei
and an appropriate table of transmission coefficients (TLCALC.DAT) are
present. If not, then the programs EBTABLE and TL should be run. The input
cards of these programs along with those of CASCADE are described below. All
formats are free formats except where indicated. For the cards with free format
the program expects a value to be entered for each parameter specified in the
read statement.
     The cards for the programs CASCN and CASCIP are compatible although CASCN
does not necessarily use some of the information that is inputted. However, it
is important that all parameters described below for the cards pertinent to the
program CASCADE should be entered for both versions CASCN and CASCIP. Where
appropriate, it is indicated which parameters are irrelevant for the program
CASCN.

	Mass number of projectile.

     <li>IZT  <br>
	Atomic number of target nucleus.

     <li>IAT  <br>
	Mass number of target nucleus.

     <li>ELAB  <br>
	Beam energy in MeV. This is interpreted as the excitation energy of
	the compound nucleus EXCN if JCN.GE.0 (see card 3) and if IAP = 0.
     </ol>

    <b>CARD 3	Spins, parity and isospin in entrance channel</b>
    <ol>

    <li>JP   <br>
	Spin of projectile (twice the value for an odd nucleus).

    <li>JT   <br>
	Spin of target (twice the value for an odd nucleus).

    <li>IP12  <br>
	Product of intrinsic parities of target and projectile.<br>
	= 0  For even parity in the entrance channel.<br>
	= 1  For odd parity in the entrance channel.<br>
	= 2  For identical 0+ nuclei.<br>
	&lt; 0  For unknown parity in the entrance channel.<br>

    <li>JCN   <br>
	&lt; 0  Usual. The population in the CN is then calculated according to
	     parameters of card 6.<br>
      .GE.0  The CN population is assumed to be in one spin JCN with a
	     population cross section of 1000 mb. The spin is JCN+1/2 for odd
	     mass. The excitation energy EXCN = ELAB (card 2) if IAP = 0. This
	     option is used for example, if one wants to study the influence of
	     the angular momentum in the CN on the decay mode. The parameters
	     on card 6 are then irrelevant but should be entered nevertheless.
	     <br>
      = 999  Then the CN population is read as a function of angular momentum,
	     parity and isospin. Card 6 is skipped in this case and instead of
	     it a number of cards are read. See further card 6.<br>

    <li>ITZT<br>
	= 1  For a T&lt; state of the compound nucleus if JCN.GE.0.<br>
	= 2  For a T&gt; state of the compound nucleus if JCN.GE.0.<br>

	This is irrelevant for program CASCN.<br>

    <li>INDPAR<br>
      = 0  Do not use option for different level densities of positive and
       negative parities in even-even nuclei. Note that for nuclei other
     than even-even the density of negative parity states as compared
     to positive parity ones depends strongly on the mass region under
     consideration.<br>
	= 1  Use.<br>
	This is irrelevant for program CASCN.

	     parity and isospin.<br>
	= 9  Print all of the above (i.e. options 1, 2 and 3).<br>
	In program CASCN only option 1 is irrelevant, however option 3 in this
	case means print level densities as function of excitation energy and
	spin.

    <li>AMIX<br>
	Parameter for isospin mixing, where isospin mixing is assumed to take
	the simple form of linear dependence as a function of excitation
	energy, i.e. isospin mixing = AMIX + BMIX*EX.<br>
	This is irrelevant for program CASCN.

    <li>BMIX<br>
	Parameter for isospin mixing. See note above concerning AMIX.
	This is irrelevant for program CASCN.

  <b>CARDS 13a Read in cascade structure (optional)</b><br>
	Only if KOPTK = 99 and IPS1, IPSMAX specified (see card 4).
	Input: IPSZO(IZF=1,4; IPS=1,IPS1) = assignment of numbers to the
	daughter nuclei produced by n-, p-, alpha- and 4th decay (IZF=1,4) of
	each decaying nucleus IPS = 1,IPS1 in the decay cascade. Defines
	length of decay chains and order of computation. Insert 0 if decay
	is to be neglected.<br>

  <b>CARDS 14</b><br>
  Individual level density parameters for low excitation energy
	  (optional; except for a card where IZ = 0)</b>

  <ol>
  <li>IZ<br>
	Atomic number Z.

  <li>IA<br>
	Mass number A.

  <li>DA<br>
	Constant for calculating the level density parameter a = A/DA,
	(DA ~ 8 MeV).

  <li>DELTA<br>
	Zero of the thermal excitation energy for the g.s., U = EX - DELTA.

  <li>FTHETA<br>
	= J/Jrigid (like on card 7).

  <li>CK<br>
	Multiplicative constant in the level density (valid for the whole
	excitation energy range).

  <li>DELT<br>
	Zero of the thermal excitation energy for the IAS.
	This is irrelevant for program CASCN.<br>

	One card for each nucleus; arbitrary number of cards; arbitrary order.
	Overwrites internally calculated standard parameters. End defined by a
	card on which IZ = 0. This card is always necessary.

   <b>CARDS 15  Individual spectra (optional; 
	except for a card where IZZ = 0, or  an EOR card)</b> 

	For each nucleus, for which low-lying levels are to be read in:<br>
    <ul>
	  <li>a) One card containing IZZ,IAA,EX
	  <li>b) Cards containing EXL,JL,PL,IL; format 7(F7.2,I2,2A).
    </ul>
	     End defined by a blank card, or an EOR card.<br>

	The input values are written, if they are needed, into a level table
	(for a maximum of 99 nuclei). If two spectra are supplied for the same
	or the mirror nucleus, the second overwrites the first one. A maximum
	of 50 levels can be given (with arbitrary order except for yrast levels
	or with interruption except for the first position on the card).<br>
  
  <b>CARD a</b>

  <ol>
  <li>IZZ<br>
	Atomic number Z. 

  <li>IAA<br>
	Mass number A.

  <li>EX<br>
   Excitation energy (in MeV) below which the analytical level density is
	erased and replaced by levels and above which the levels are
	interpreted as yrast levels (level density erased above the spin of the
	level). Yrast levels must be read in with increasing or constant spin
	at increasing excitation energy.
   </ol>
   <b>CARDS b   Format(7(F7.2,I2,2A)</b>
   <ol>
  <li>EXL<br>
	Level excitation energy in MeV.

  <li>JL<br>
	Level spin (twice for odd nuclei).

  <li>PL<br>
	Level parity.<br>
	= +  Positive parity.<br>
	= -  Negative parity.<br>
	= 0  Or blank start reading cards for another nucleus (see card a).<br>
	Any other character =&gt; undefined parity.

  <li>IL<br>
	Level isospin.<br>
	= &lt;  Lower isospin T&lt;.<br>
	= &gt;  Upper isospin T&gt;.<br>
	Any other character will stop the program with an error message.
	This is irrelevant for program CASCN.
